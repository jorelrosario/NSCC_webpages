                <dt><strong>Chicago 18 &mdash;Released date:1986</strong></dt>
                    <dd> Chicago 18 is the fifteenth studio album the rock band released. One of my favorite songs from this album
                        is "Will you Still Love me?". This album is definitely missing a key component.
                        Without the original lead vocalist, the band was forced to explore new sounds. They tried replicating the warmth and smoothness of Cetera, but were unsuccessful.
                        I still believe it's a good, and important album because one can notice the difference between prior albums. It marks the end of Peter's time and 
                        a new version of Chicago. 
                <dt><strong>Chicago 17 &mdash; Released date:1984</strong></dt>
                    <dd> Chicago 17 was the peak of Chicago's best time during the 80's prior to Peter Cetera leaving the band.
                        Peter Cetera was the former and original vocalist of the band since 1967, which gave the band a particular sound and warmth. 
                        I still remember listening to "You're My Inspiration in the 90's. Peter's voice in my opinion was very special, and could capture anyone's attention. 

                <dt><strong>Chicago 16 &mdash; Released date:1982</strong></dt>
                        <dd>Chicago 16 was one of the most successful albums the band released during the 80's.
                            In this album the songs "What you're missing", "Hard to Say I'm Sorry", and "Love Me Tomorrow" are all top charted songs from the. 
                        This album debuts their new sound style which focuses on more pop and than rock, which ultimately let the band 
                    to transition to soft rock/pop rock completely.</dd>
